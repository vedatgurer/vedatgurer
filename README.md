- 👋 Hi, I’m @vedatgurer
- 👀 I’m interested in many subjects; crypo governance models, weighted voting, ICO tokenomics, ecosystem oracles, verification nodes, decision proposal models etc..
- 🌱 I’m currently learning solidify, phyton (I don't hove too much spare time, so, I'm a very very slow learner..)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on asset backed, quasi tokenized, transparent, somehow decentralized for sure, trustless financial projects
- 📫 How to reach me ... vedatgurer@gmail.com
